GPS Track Server for TrackMe, OruxMaps and others

== Description ==

NOTE: Trackserver v5.0 contains backwards-incompatible changes and changes to client configurations are needed. Please read the [release notes][releasenotes] for more information.

Getting your GPS tracks into Wordpress and publishing them has never been easier!

Trackserver is a plugin for storing and publishing GPS routes. It is a server companion to several mobile apps for location tracking, and it can display maps with your tracks on them by using a shortcode. It can also be used for live tracking, where your visitors can follow you or your users on a map.

Unlike other plugins that are about maps and tracks, Trackserver's main focus is not the publishing, but rather the collection and storing of tracks and locations. It's all about keeping your data to yourself. Several mobile apps and protocols are supported for getting tracks into trackserver:

* [TrackMe][trackme]
* [MapMyTracks protocol][mapmytracks], for example using [OruxMaps][oruxmaps], including upload functionality
* [OsmAnd's][osmand] live tracking protocol
* [ÂµLogger][ulogger]
* [GPSLogger][gpslogger]
* [PhoneTrack-Android][phonetrack] also works with OsmAnd's protocol (Trackserver >= 4.3)
* [SendLocation][sendlocation]
* [Traccar client][traccar]
* [OwnTracks][owntracks] (experimental support)
* HTTP POST, for example using [AutoShare][autoshare]

A shortcode [tsmap] is provided for displaying your tracks on a map. Maps are displayed using the fantastic [Leaflet library][leafletjs] and some useful Leaflet plugins are included. Maps can be viewed in full-screen on modern browsers.

To publish a map with a track in a post or a page, just include the shortcode:

[tsmap track=&lt;id&gt;]

See the FAQ section for more information on the shortcode's supported attributes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the available shortcode attributes? =

For the [tsmap] shortcode:

* track: one or more track IDs, separated by commas, or 'live' (deprecated, 'user=@' is preferred).
* id: an alias for 'track'
* user: one or more user IDs, separated by commas, who's latest track to follow 'live'. A literal '@' means the author of the post (you). When viewing the map, the liveupdate feature will follow the track of the first user specified. When the end-marker is enabled for a live track (and why shouldn't it?), clicking it will change the focus of the liveupdate to that track. The map view will follow the latest location and the infobar (if present) will display its information.
* live: true (or 't', 'yes' or 'y'), or false (default), to force live tracking for this map. This can be used for example with an externally updated GPX or KML file.
* maxage: the maximum age of a live track for it to be included on the map. If this parameter is given, all user tracks that have not been updated in the last X amount of time, will not be displayed. The value is a time expression in the form of a number and a unit, for example: '120s', '30m', '2h', '3d'.
* delay: the delay of a live track for its locations to appear on the map. If this parameter is given, all user tracks only show their data up to a point in time X amount ago. The value is a time expression in the form of a number and a unit, for example: '120s', '30m', '2h', '3d'.
* width: map width, default: 100%.
* height: map height, default: 480px.
* align: 'left', 'center' or 'right', default: not set.
* class: a CSS class to add to the map div for customization, default: not set.
* continuous: true (default) or false (or 'f', 'no' or 'n'), for lack of a better word, to indicate whether multiple tracks should be considered as one continuous track. The only effect this has, at the moment, is that intermediate start markers are yellow instead of green.
* gpx: one or more URLs to GPX files to be plotted on the map. Multiple URLs should be separated by spaces, and the value as a whole enclosed by double quotes (gpx="http://....gpx http://....gpx"). If enabled in the settings, when a url is prefixed with the string 'proxy:', the request is proxied through Trackserver.
* kml: one or more URLs to KML files to be plotted on the map. Multiple URLs should be separated by spaces, and the value as a whole enclosed by double quotes (kml="http://....kml http://....kml"). If enabled in the settings, when a url is prefixed with the string 'proxy:', the request is proxied through Trackserver.
* infobar: true (or 't', 'yes' or 'y'), false (default), or a template string, to specify whether an information bar should be shown on the map, when live tracking is active. This only works with 'track=live' or the 'user' parameter, and has no effect in other cases. When multiple live tracks are requested, the infobar will display the data of the first track only. Instead of 'true' or 'yes', a template string containing one or more placeholders (like {lat}, {lon}, {speedkmh}, etc.) can be given to the attribute, in which case it overrides the value specified in the user profile. Please check the Trackserver user profile page in the WordPress backend for which placeholders are supported.
* zoom: the zoom factor to use for the map, a number between 0 and 18. For a map with live tracks, this number is absolute. For a map with only static tracks, this number represents the maximum zoom level, so the map will always fit all the tracks.

The following attributes apply to tracks that are drawn on the map. Each of them can contain multiple values, separated by commas (or colons, in the case of 'dash'), to be applied to different tracks in order. If there a are less values than tracks, the last value will be applied to the remaining tracks.

* markers: one or more of the following values: true (default) or false (or 'f', 'no' or 'n') to disable start/end markers on the track. The value can also be 'start', 's', 'end' or 'e', to draw markers only for the start or the end of a track respectively.
* markersize: one or more integer values, separated by commas, to use as the size / radius of the start/end markers of the track. Default is 5.
* color: one or more colors, separated by commas, to use for the tracks on the map. Default comes from Leaflet.
* weight: one or more weights, separated by commas, to use for the tracks on the map. Default comes from Leaflet.
* opacity: one or more opacities, separated by commas, to use for the tracks on the map. Default comes from Leaflet.
* dash: one or more [dashArrays][dasharray], seperated by colons (:), to use for the tracks on the map. Default is no dashes.
* points: true (or 't', 'yes' or 'y'), or false (default), to specify whether the track should be displayed as a line or a collection of points.

[dasharray]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-dasharray

Example: [tsmap track=39,84 user=@ align=center class=mymap markers=n color=#ff0000]

When you specify multiple values, please be aware of the following. While track order will be preserved within each track type, different track types are evaluated in a specific order, and styling values are applied in that order too. The order is:

1. Static tracks (track=a,b,c)
2. Live user tracks (user=x,y,z)
3. GPX tracks (gpx=...)
4. KML tracks (kml=...)

To prevent confusion, I suggest you specify tracks in this order in your shortcode too.

Example: [tsmap gpx=/url/for/file.gpx user=jim track=10,99 color=red,blue,green,yellow]

In this case, the GPX track will be yellow, Jim's live track will be green and tracks 10 and 99 will be red and blue respectively.

In a feature request I was asked to make it possible to draw just a marker on the last known location, and not draw a track at all. Use 'markers' and 'opacity' to accomplish this:

Example: [tsmap user=@ markers=e opacity=0.0]

Attributes for the [tslink] shortcode:

* track: same as for [tsmap]
* id: same as for [tsmap]
* user: same as for [tsmap]
* text: the text to render insde the &lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt; tags
* class: a CSS class to apply to the 'a' element
* format: the format in which to download the tracks. Only 'gpx' (the default) is supported at this time. Other formats like KML may follow. Send a feature request if you need a specific format.

Example: [tslink track=1,2,3,4 text="Download the tracks of our 4-day hike in GPX format"]

Instead of using the 'text' attribute, you can also use shortcode to enclose the text:

Example: [tslink track=1,2,3,4]Download the tracks of our 4-day hike in GPX format[/tslink]

= I used the shortcode but the map doesn't show =

Trackserver tries to detect the usage of the [tsmap] shortcode to prevent unnecessary loading of the plugin's JavaScript. In some circumstances, for example, if your page setup is complex and uses multiple loops, the detection could fail. In such a case, use this shortcode in the main post or page to force loading the JavaScript:

[tsscripts]

There is one caveat. Trackserver only works on 'real' posts and pages, in WordPress terms. For example, some WordPress themes (I have seen one) offer the possibility to specify a static homepage right in the theme settings, completely overriding WordPress' internal post logic. In this case, the page lacks an author as well as other properties that a regular WordPress post or page has. Trackserver's [tsmap] shortcode does not work on pages like that.

All that said, Trackserver's shortcode detection should be reasonably fool-proof these days, because if the early detection mechanism fails, the shortcode itself is used to trigger the inclusion of Trackserver's JavaScript and CSS. The only adverse side effect this may have, is that the CSS is loaded in the footer of the page, rather than in the head section. It's hard to say whether this will actually be a problem, but just in case it is, the [tsscripts] shortcode is there.

Beware though: the [tsscripts] shortcode doesn't actually do anything. At all. It is merely an extra shortcode that Trackserver tries to detect. Therefore, it is absolutely useless to include [tsscripts] in the same context as your [tsmap]. I appreciate that this can be hard to understand, so let me illustrate with an example. Take the 'Posts in page' plugin, that allows you to use a shortcode in a post (let's call it A) to include other posts an pages inline (let's call them B and C). If [tsmap] is used in B or C, but the page requested by the user is A, which does not have a [tsmap], Trackserver's shortcode detection used to fail in earlier versions, and the Javascript and CSS would not be loaded. By using the [tsscripts] shortcode in page A, the loading of JS and CSS can be forced. The CSS will then be loaded in the head of the page, instead of in the footer.

= Trying to show a GPX or KML file shows an error popup: "Track could not be loaded: undefined undefined" =

This will happen when you try to load a file from a different domain than your site is running on, and the remote server doesn't serve a 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header that allows acces to the file. Your webbrowser refuses to process the file. Check the console in your developer tools for an error message. Please read up on [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) for more information. This is not something that Trackserver can fix.

= What is live tracking? =

By using the shortcode with the 'user=...' or 'track=live' parameter, the most recently updated track belonging to the specified user(s) or the author of the current post/page is published on the map.

The track is updated with the latest trackpoints every 10 seconds and the map view is always centered to the most recent trackpoint. A marker is shown in that location. Live tracking can be stopped and restarted with a simple control button that is shown on the map.

To publish other users' tracks, the author of the page needs the 'trackserver_publish' capability, which is by default only granted to administrators and editors.

= What is a Trackserver user profile? (since v1.9) =

Before v1.9, all of Trackserver's settings were stored in a single, global place in WordPress, meaning they were shared among all users in the same WordPress install. This was also the case for the OsmAnd access key that allows OsmAnd users to use Trackserver for live tracking. Since Trackserver tries to be multi-user, things like access keys do not belong in the global configuration.

In version 1.9, user profile settings were introduced as a place for per-user settings, like access keys. There is a separate page in the WordPress admin for the Trackserver profile (called 'Your profile' in English), that is accessible by all users that have the right (capability) to use Trackerver.

= What is an embedded map? =

In version 4.3, a feature called 'Embedded maps' was introduced. Embedded maps are a custom WordPress post type, which are intended to have no other content than a map, filling up the entire browser window, or the container they are loaded in. They bypass your active WordPress theme and use a custom template that displays <i>only</i> the content of your 'Embedded map' post, without any headers, sidebars or even styling. This allows you to embed the map with your tracks in another website using an <i>iframe</i>. Trackserver will tell you the HTML code to use for embedding the map. They also look great on mobile devices, if all you really care about is the map and what's on it.

I'm not sure about the usefulness of this feature to everyone who uses Trackserver, but personally I use it for mixing interactive maps with photos and videos in my online photo album.

= What changed for TrackMe authentication 1.9? =

TrackMe, like OsmAnd, uses HTTP GET requests for communication with Trackserver.  This means that all data from the app, including your password, becomes part of the URL. Because URLs are not generally considered secret, and may be logged in access logs and what not, this is quite insecure, even with HTTPS.

For OsmAnd, that has no built-in authentication, Trackserver has used an access key instead of your WordPress password from the very beginning. For TrackMe, this was implemented in v1.9. So from version 1.9 onward, every WordPress user that is allowed to use Trackserver has its own separate access key for OsmAnd and a separate password for TrackMe, settable in the Trackme user profile.

If you have been using Trackserver with TrackMe before v1.9, you should now set the password in TrackMe to this new password, instead of your WordPress password.  Like your password, you should keep your access keys to yourself, but the idea is that the security impact of such a key is low, compared to your WordPress password, and that you can (and should!) change the keys regularly.  No real effort is made to keep the keys secure (they are stored in the database unhashed, for example), so in any case, try not to use a sensitive password.

= What is this 'slug' you are talking about? =

Slugs are generally defined as URL-friendly and unique versions of a name or title. In WordPress, they are short descriptions of posts and pages, to be used in URLs (permalinks). They are the part of the URL that makes WordPress serve a particular page. Trackserver uses slugs to 'listen' for tracking requests from mobile apps, and you can configure these slugs to be anything you want.  Trackserver comes with default values for these slugs, that should work for most people. Changing them is usually not necessary nor recommended. Please
read the WARNING blow before changing them.

Please refer to the [Wordpress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#Slug) for more information about slugs in general.

WARNING: please do not confuse the slugs that you configure in Trackserver with the URLs (permalinks) that you use to publish your maps and tracks. Above all, make sure there is no conflict between the permalink for a post or page and the slugs that Trackserver uses for location updates. The slugs in Trackerver's configuration are for the location updates ONLY. If you try to open them in a browser, you will get errors like 'Illegal request'. Trackserver operates on a low level within WordPress, so if there is a conflict between Trackserver and a post or a page, Trackserver will win and the page will be inaccessible.

To publish your tracks, simply create a page (with a non-conflicting permalink) and use the [tsmap] shortcode to add a map.

= Can Trackserver support protocol X or device Y? =

Trackserver, being a WordPress plugin, can only support HTTP-based protocols for tracking. Many tracking devices use TCP- but not HTTP-based protocols for online tracking, and as such, Trackserver cannot support them, at least not without some middleware that translates the device's protocol to HTTP.

If a device or an app does use HTTP as a transport, adding support for it in Trackserver should be quite easy. For example, I have been thinking about support for the GpsGate Server Protocol. It could be added if there is any demand for it.

If a device or an app uses a different transport, support could be added by implementing some sort of middleware. For example, [OwnTracks](http://owntracks.org/) uses MQTT and ships with a script ([m2s](https://github.com/owntracks/backend/tree/master/m2s)) for storing the data. Storage methods in m2s are pluggable, so one could write an m2s-plugin for shipping the data to Trackserver.

= How does TrackMe Cloud Sharing work with Trackserver? =

TrackMe has a feature called 'Cloud Sharing', that is meant to enable users to follow other users' locations on a map. The TrackMe app uses a different method to send location updates than for regular tracking updates. Also, it sends Cloud Sharing requests without authentication credentials, which made it hard to implement in Trackserver. Given that TrackMe sends authentication credentials in an insecure way in any case, I decided to implement a workaround for the missing credentials, by embedding them in the server URL. So, in stead of sending a request like this:

https://example.com/trackme/requests.z?username=myuser&password=mypass

we configure TrackMe to send requests like this:

https://example.com/trackme/myuser/mypass/requests.z?username=&password=

This way, it also works for cloud sharing requests, and we can get the username and password from the URL.

If you have been using TrackMe with the old style Server URL, and you try to use the cloud sharing feature, you will see a message along the lines of 'For cloud sharing you need to update your server URL, see Trackserver FAQ.'. This means you have to update the settings in the TrackMe app to contain your username and TrackMe password in the server URL. The complete server URL can be found in your Trackserver profile as always, and the old style URL is now deprecated. Switching to the new style URL also means, that the username and password that you set in the app will no longer be used, and you can leave those settings empty.

Please also read the FAQ above: 'What changed for TrackMe authentication 1.9'. The new URL scheme is slightly more insecure in some cases, since with the new scheme it is even more certain that your TrackMe password will end up in the server's access logs. Other than that, there is no difference. Remember to always use HTTPS, and change your TrackMe password often, since it will give full read/write access to your Trackserver tracks.

In Trackserver, Cloud Sharing behaves a little differently than in the official TrackMe server. The official server only remembers the latest location update for your device ID. It also has a notion of 'public' vs 'non-public' location sharing, where 'non-public' requires some permissions exchange over mobile text message. Trackserver does not do 'public' sharing. Also, location updates that arrive via the cloud sharing feature are treated the same as any other update: they are stored as a track. The only difference with normal tracking is, that the track name is generated by Trackserver. A new track is created when the date changes. The track name format is 'TrackMe Cloud yyyy-mm-dd'. This is not configurable at this time, but that may change in the furture.

= What about security? =

**Using Trackserver**

The plugin uses a few custom Wordpress capabilities ('use_trackserver', 'trackserver_publish' and 'trackserver_admin') to manage the various levels of access within Trackserver:

* To use the tracking features and manage and publish one's own tracks, the 'use_trackserver' capability is required. It is granted to authors, editors and administrators, but not to subscribers.
* To publish other people's tracks, the 'trackserver_publish' capability is required. It is granted to editors and administrators.
* To manage Trackserver's options, the 'trackserver_admin' capability is required. Only admins get this capability by default.

If you remove one or more capabilities from the listed roles, they will be re-granted on (re)activation of the plugin.

Tracks can only be published in Wordpress posts or pages, and cannot be downloaded from outside Wordpress. Requests for downloading tracks need to have a cryptographic signature (called a 'nonce') that only Wordpress can generate.

Regarding the use of apps for live tracking and uploading to Wordpress, please read the considerations about authentication above.

**External tracks proxy**

Trackserver contains code that can proxy requests to- and serve content from remote 3rd-party servers. This allows authors to work around CORS restrictions. Instead of letting the visitor's browser get the GPX or KML from the remote server (which only works if the server implements CORS headers to allow the request), the request is sent to WordPress, where Trackserver will fetch the track from the remote server and send it to the browser.

This opens all kinds of interesting possibilities, but it is also a security risk. Your authors can use the proxy function to invoke HTTP requests to remote servers, which now originate from your server, and the response of which will be processed by your WordPress installation. This could have different adverse effects, ranging from legal liability to denial-of-service on your server.

Therefore, the proxy function is disabled by default. It can be enabled in the 'advanced' section of Trackserver's settings, but I recommend to only enable it if you need it, and if you trust your authors not to use it on harmful URLs.

The proxy code can be invoked via a 'gettrack' request, but like all requests for tracks, it has to be signed with a valid nonce, so it should be impossible to abuse the proxy from outside WordPress.

= What GPX namespaces are supported for GPX import (via HTTP POST or upload via backend)? =

GPX 1.1 (http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1) and GPX 1.0 (http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/0).

= Is it free? =
Yes. Donations are welcome. Please visit http://www.grendelman.net/wp/trackserver-wordpress-plugin/ for details.

== Changelog ==

= v5.0.2 =
Release date: 05 March 2023

Fixed:
* Regression with viewing tracks in WP backend via bulk action.

= v5.0.1 =
Release date: 06 February 2023

Fixed:
* JS localization warning in WP backend.

= v5.0 =
Release date: 06 February 2023

This release contains many changes. Please read these notes carefully.

BIG CHANGE: Trackserver URL change for all supported apps. Starting with v5.0, Trackserver uses a single URL slug for all supported apps. This means all users have to update the server URL in the mobile apps they use for tracking. App-specific URLs still work, but will be removed in a future version. After upgrading, visit the Trackserver Options page and look at the 'Full URL' lines at the top. There are two versions of the universal URL. Trackserver will tell you which URL to use in which app.

BIG CHANGE: App-specific passwords and access keys (used for TrackMe, OsmAnd and SendLocation) have been transformed into 'App Passwords', and are now app-independent. Existing access keys are automatically converted to App Passwords during the upgrade, and will all be valid for all supported apps, including the apps that worked with your WordPress password before (OruxMaps / MapMyTracks and OwnTracks). Your WordPress password will still work for those apps, but that may change in a future release. Switching to App Passwords is recommended, regardless of the app you use for Tracking. The main benefit is an increase in security, because your WordPress password will no longer be necessary for using Trackserver. Trackserver App Passwords can be changed often without impacting WordPress logins. As an added bonus, App Passwords also work in WordPress installs that use SSO mechanisms like OAuth2 for user logins.

Added:
* A search box on the tracks management page.
* Experimental uLogger support.
* Universal slug for all protocols that Trackserver supports.
* App passwords.
* Generic 'GET request' support for storing locations, used for OsmAnd and Sendlocation support.
* 'Duplicate' bulk action for copying tracks.
* Some useful links to Github and Trackserver home page from the Plugins page in WP admin.

Changed:
* Big code restructuring changes. The main Trackserver class has been split up in different utility classes. Each protocol that Trackserver supports now lives in its own PHP class, as do the different WP admin pages and the shortcode handling code. Abstractions for database fuctionss, and data like tracks and locations have been created.
* Rewrite parts of the MapMyTracks protocol handling, to make it more robust.
* Internalized the polyline encoder for performance improvement.
* Update Leaflet, first to v1.7.1. then via v1.8.0 to v1.9.3.

Fixed:
* Embedded maps. The previously shipped template was broken and embedded maps did not actually work.
* Include tracks without locations in the list of tracks.
* CSS improvements.
* Better TrackMe error handling.
* A bug in metadata generation for polyline output.
* A PHP error when there are no posts in the $wp_query. Thanks, @caveman99.

Removed:
* TrackMe support via the WP AJAX interface. It was never used.

= v4.3.2 =
Release date: 10 September 2019

Fixed:
* Database structure modifications that were missing on new installs of v4.3.
* The default trackformat was changed from polyline to geojson by mistake.

= v4.3.1 =
Release date: 10 September 2019

Changed:
* Some code restructuring.

Fixed:
* A JavaScript conflict with the 'Leaflet Map' WordPress plugin.
* Markers on maps in the WP admin were almost invisible due to undefined marker size.

= v4.3 =
Release date: 6 September 2019

This release requires WordPress v4.7 or higher.

Added:
* Custom post type 'tsmap' for creating embedded maps.
* Infobar template placeholder for track name: {trackname}.
* Experimental support for TrackMe Cloud Sharing. To use this, you have to change the 'URL header' setting in TrackMe. Please see the Trackserver FAQ for details.
* Support for PhoneTrack-Android via the OsmAnd protocol.
* Support for optional HTTP Basic Authentication on the OsmAnd protocol.
* Support for setting the 'Source' field of a track via a URL parameter in the OsmAnd protocol.
* Support for unicode characters in text fields through charset/collation changes in DB tables.
* Shortcode attribute 'markersize', for specifying the size (radius) of start/end markers on tracks.

Changed:
* Trackserver now only supports WP 4.7 or higher.
* Re-enstate GeoJSON support for the 'gettrack' method (not for 'gettrack_query')
* Updated Leaflet, first to version 1.4.0 and then to 1.5.1.
* Start restructuring the plugin code into multiple classes.
* The 'Share with friend / Follow friends' feature that was tied to OwnTracks now also applies to Trackme Cloud Sharing.

Fixed:
* Make the 'Show x items' selector in the 'Manage tracks' page actually do something.
* Escape HTML entities in the infobar.
* Escape HTML in track names when viewing maps in the WordPress backend.
* Translation of strings related to Embedded maps by loading the translation domain earlier.
* An issue where we tried to translate a piece of HTML code.
* Coding style updates, update WPCS to v2.1.1.
* Change the default value of timestamp fields in the database, for compatibility with MySQL 5.7+ / NO_ZERO_IN_DATE.
* Add a multicolumn index on the locations table, for better performance of certain database queries.
* Missing metadata on all but the last live track in a map. Thanks to @pisoni for reporting it and suggesting a fix. The fix does incur a performance penalty though.

= v4.2.3 =
Release date: 21 August 2019

* Fix a bug with converting timestamps to UTC for GPX output. Thanks to @jeremybeckett for reporting it.

= v4.2.2 =
Release date: 18 October 2018

* Fix Leaflet JS/CSS URLs, this change was forgotten to be included in v4.2

= v4.2.1 =
Release date: 18 October 2018

* Update Dutch translation for changes in v4.2

= v4.2 =
Release date: 18 October 2018

* Add some replacement tags for the infobar. All relevant metric and imperial units are now represented, and some of the tags now have different variants for specifying the number of decimals. Please see the text near the form field in your Trackserver profile for more information. Backwards-incompatible change: the distance and speed tags now have 0 decimals by default, that used to be 2.
* After a network error, remove error popup from the map on the next succesful track load.
* Updated Leaflet to version 1.3.4.

IMPORTANT BUGFIX: If you did a fresh install of v4.0, a column was missing from a database table,
causing location updates and GPX file uploads to fail. This release adds the column if it is missing.

Fixed:
* Updated Lithuanian translation. Thanks, Dainius Kaupaitis.

This is a BIG update. Please read https://www.grendelman.net/wp/trackserver-v3-0-released/ for the full story!

* Fix a bug where Trackserver would only import the first segment of a track from GPX.
* Get rid of suboptimal shortcode detection fallback mechanism.
* Upgrade Leaflet to version 1.0.3.
* Sync trackserver-omnivore.js with leaflet-omnivore-0.3.4.
* Update leaflet-liveupdate to version 1.1
* Fix a bug in the admin where some superfluous text was included in track URLs.
* Implement loading all tracks for a map in a single HTTP request.
* Add WordPress MultiUser support.
* Replace track marker images by L.CircleMarker objects and gain dynamic marker colouring. The old images are removed from the plugin installation.
* Add {userid}, {userlogin} and {displayname} as possible tags in the infobar template.
* Add 'user' attribute to 'tsmap' shortcode, for displaying multiple users' live tracks in a map.
* Add 'live' attribute to force live-update without live tracks, for use with external (gpx/kml) tracks. It can also be used to force-disable live updates for maps with user tracks.
* Add 'zoom' attribute to influence the initial zoom level of the map. Behaves differently for maps with live tracks than for maps with only static tracks.
* Add 'id' attribute as an alias for 'track', because I keep using that for some strange reason.
* Maps without live tracks now start at zoom level 12 instead of 6, until the tracks are loaded.
* Remove support for GeoJSON as Trackserver's internal trackformat, only polyline remains.
* Shortcode parameters 'markers', 'color', 'weight', 'opacity' and 'points' can now contain a comma-separated list of values, which will be applied to respective tracks in the 'track', 'user', 'gpx' or 'kml' attributes (in that order). If less values than tracks are given, the last value is applied to all remaining tracks.
* Add 'dash' attribute, behaving the same as 'markers', 'color', etc. to specify a 'dashArray' to use for the track(s).
* Make the 'weight' parameter control the point radius when 'points=y'
* It is now possible to mix 'track', 'user', 'gpx' and 'kml' in a single map.
* Add a new shortcode called 'tslink', that produces a download link for one or more tracks in a single file. Only GPX is supported at this time.
* Documentation updates and additions.
* Make end-markers on a live-map clickable to make liveupdate follow that track.
* Rename a column in the tracks table, it has been misnamed since v1.0.
* Add an uninstall.php file that removes database tables and options.
* Add WordPress MultiUser support.
* Add a debug function for writing stuff to debug.log.
* Add Promise-polyfill by Taylor Hakes, to support older browsers (most notably IE 9-11).

= v2.3 =

* Calculate and update speed per trackpoint when calculating the track distance.

Release date: 6 June 2016

* Implement MapMyTracks 'upload_activity' request. You can now upload tracks to trackserver directly from OruxMaps without the use of AutoShare.
